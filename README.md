# how-far-are-the-stars
This is a self project using python programming language. I have used a fits file of messier 102, I calculated distance of NGC 5866 galaxy (also known as the spindle galaxy) using a calibration star. I used astropy, sep, fitsio, and matplotlib libraries in the code for source detection and FITS file handling.
